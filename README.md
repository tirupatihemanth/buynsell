This repository is to share the work among ourselves( WEBOPS @ IITM ) and to improve the coordination among the team members and hope fully making this BUYNSELL A BIG SUCCESS without compromising at any part. It is said that "ALWAYS IT'S WE THAT MAKE ANY PROJECT BIG OR SMALL" :)

STATISTICS:
	Basic version of the website is built with facilities like users login-logout, Users can wish to see their posts or the posts of all the people

        Finished upto user filling details password reset part and added few basic features

TARGET FEATURES:

	1. To dynamically load posts as the user scrolls down using ajax
	2. Enhansed user interface
	3. Users Should be able to upload photos of their products
	4. In posts All the products must be arranged in the form of a grid or cards(showing just basic info like price and a photograph) and when the user clicks on of the grids he should get that enlarged to give photos uploaded by user(user can upload as many as he wishes to) and the details of the person who uploaded it
	5. Add the facilities such as email the person there itself
	6. Efficient search engine in the posts page using different tags etc.,
	7. Segregating the posts based on the category while displaying to an user
	8. Peer to peer messaging service in the site itself where an user can send message directly to the person who sells a particular object(This service helps a lot as the other user when checks in he can get the message as notification)
	9.facility to register products. Say I would like to buy a product and register it when I register seller gets a notification about the user who registers and they can then have a conversation if they don't agree upon then user can unregister the post i.e then it is available for the other persons too we keep some restrictions on this facility so that it is fair for both buyers and sellers
	10.An android app to track the status of their products whether they have got a message from some user or not and most of the features available in the website has to be incorporated into the app. This app is very important as most of the users rely on mobile phones :)
	
	These are the target features I thought of. We can incorporate all these features If I remember somemore features I will append them. Because Only with all these features we can be comparable to the facebook page BUYNSELL @ IITM :)
